# image_colorization
This project turns old black-and-white images into colorful ones using AI. It uses smart tools that learn how to add realistic colors automatically. You just run one script, choose your image, and the output gets saved for you to compare different results.

**install dependencies**

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

**Colorize!** This script will colorize an image. The results should match the images in the `imgs_out` folder.

```
python demo_release.py -i imgs/ansel_adams3.jpg
```

**Model loading in Python** The following loads pretrained colorizers. See [demo_release.py](demo_release.py) for some details on how to run the model. There are some pre and post-processing steps: convert to Lab space, resize to 256x256, colorize, and concatenate to the original full resolution, and convert to RGB.

```python
import colorizers
colorizer_eccv16 = colorizers.eccv16().eval()
colorizer_siggraph17 = colorizers.siggraph17().eval()
```
